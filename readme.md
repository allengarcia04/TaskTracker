## Motivation
TaskTracker was born out of my personal journey when I migrated to Australia. I embarked on a mission to earn a Master's degree in Business Information Systems and secure a software engineering job. Upon arriving, I faced the challenge of managing numerous aspirations. The lack of organization prompted me to create TaskTracker, a solution that allows me to write, add, and track my goals efficiently. This project is designed to bring order to the chaos, enabling users to navigate their tasks, goals and achieve success.

## Features
User registration and login
Task creation and deletion
